# UnityExamQuestion

Please clone the git repository and use the ready made assets in the project to create a scene where you can control the character to battle with a placeholder enemy object.

Git Repository : https://github.com/EndlessClouds/UnityExamQuestion.git

The assignment specifications are shown as below:

1) As a player, on key press (AWSD), I can move the player in any direction.
2) As a player, per each key press (P), I can use the sword provided to attack once onto any placeholder objects such as a cube.
3) As a player, I can take damage if I get hit by placeholder projectiles (sphere) that get fired towards the player by the enemy once every 3 seconds.
4) As a player, on key press (SPACE), I can perform a dodge in the direction where the character is facing to avoid damage.
5) As a player, after 5 hits, the placeholder enemy will die (disappear) and respawn at a random location within a radius of 3.

Commit everything to your own personal Github, Gitlab, or Bitbucket. Expose the repository as public so we can clone it. Please make sure we can build, run the Unity scene on Mac or Windows platform without errors and provide a simple and clear document in the git markdown.
